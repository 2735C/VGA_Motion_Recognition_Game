REQP-1839#1 Warning
RAMB36 async control check  
The RAMB36E1 U_frame_buffer/mem_reg_0_0 has an input control pin U_frame_buffer/mem_reg_0_0/ADDRARDADDR[14] (net: U_frame_buffer/ADDRARDADDR[14]) which is driven by a register (U_OV7670_MemController/h_counter_reg[7]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.

RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 U_pattern_ROM/p_Data_reg_1 has an input control pin U_pattern_ROM/p_Data_reg_1/ADDRARDADDR[13] (net: U_pattern_ROM/sel[9]) which is driven by a register (U_Point_In_Polygon/p_addr_reg_reg[5]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>
